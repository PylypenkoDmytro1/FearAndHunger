            <h2>Sylvian</h2>
                <p>A goddess of fertility, love, lust, and creation. She is one of the Old Gods worshipped by man, before man decided that they had enough of the old world order and wanted to supplant these ancient deities. Like Gro-goroth, the god of human sacrifices and her direct antithesis, she comes from the green hue.</p>
                <p>Sylvian created men and women at the dawn of time, the creation of the world. She ordered a deity known as Vitruvia to create an architectural reprography of a man and a woman that would be the likeness of Sylvian herself. She fell in love with the results and created mankind according to Vitruvia's drawings. Because of this, she could be seen as a Mother Goddess, the one that brought life to everyone in many ways, while Gro-goroth, her opposite, brought death to everyone in many ways. A beautiful balance and duality one can say from reading about the two. Her union with Gro-goroth also spawned another old god: Vinushka, the god of nature.</p>
